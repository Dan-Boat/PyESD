UNITTEST FRAMEWORK
------------------
The package is tested using the unittest framework with synthetic generated data.
The testing scripts are located in the ``test`` folder found in ``\tests``. Running the various scripts with -v flag (higher level of verbose),
would validate the modified version of the package.
