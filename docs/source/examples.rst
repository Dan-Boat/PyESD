Practical examples
===================

The package has been used in these projects (involving actual weather stations).

1. Downscaling of precipitation and temperature for weather station located in the Neckar catchment, Southwestern Germany üåé
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This illustrative case study of downscaling temperature and precipitation in a 
catchment located in southwestern Germany was described in the package description 
paper of pyESD `(Boateng and Mutz, 2023 <https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2023-67/>)`_. All the modeling and analysis scripts are 
available on GitHub (`PyESD/example/Neckar <https://github.com/Dan-Boat/PyESD/tree/main/examples/Neckar>`_) and also on Zenodo (`supporting material <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7767681>`). For more details about the findings, 
kindly refer to `(Boateng and Mutz, 2023 <https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2023-67/>)`_."


2. Downscaling of precipitation for synoptic weather stations in Ghana üåç using Stacked Generalization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project provides station-based precipitation downscaling for the 20 synoptic 
weather stations (obtained from the Ghana Meteorology Agency) in Ghana. The 
project highlights the importance of ensemble learning included in the pyESD package
 due to the difficulty of predicting precipitation by climate models and its representation 
 in reanalysis datasets. We used stacking ensembles for model training and compared the 
 projected downscaled future projections to the raw outputs of RCMs and the GCMs. All the 
 modeling scripts are available on GitHub (`PyESD/example/Ghana <https://github.com/Dan-Boat/PyESD/tree/main/examples/Ghana>`_). Details about the results are under preparation 
 but were presented at last year‚Äôs AGU (`link <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFM.H25A..04A/abstract>`_):

*Opportunities and challenges of empirical statistical downscaling in Ghana 
(under preparation to be submitted to AGU Earth‚Äôs future).*

3. Station-based statistical emulators for stable oxygen isotopes
------------------------------------------------------------------

The PP-ESD framework is evaluated for its performance in predicting station-based 
stable oxygen isotopes in precipitation for the GNIP stations across Europe. This 
project plans to use pyESD as a statistical emulator to predict the oxygen isotope 
and compare its performance to iso-GCM simulation. All the modeling scripts will be 
publicly available.
