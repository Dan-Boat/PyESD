**Python framwork for Empirical Statistical Downscaling**

PyESD is an open-source framework of the Perfect Prognosis approach of statistical downscaling of 
any climate-related variable such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed using reanalysis 
products eg. ERA5 as predictors. The package features all the downscaling cycles including data 
preprocessing, predictor selection, constructions (eg. using transformers), model selection, 
training, validation and evaluation, and future prediction. The package serves as the means 
of downscaling General Circulation Models of future climate to high resolution relevant for 
climate impact assessment such as droughts, flooding, wildfire risk, and others. The main 
specialties of the pyESD include:

- Well designed in an OOP style that considers weather stations as individual objects and all the
  downscaling routines as attributes. This ensures fewer lines of code that cover the end-to-end downscaling of climate change variable products.

- PyESD features many machine learning algorithms and predictor selection techniques that can 
  be experimented with toward the selection and design of robust transfer functions that can be coupled with GCM to generate future estimates of climate change.

- And many other functionalities that are highlighted in the paper description of the package 
(under review in Geoscience Model Development (GMD): `Boateng & Mutz 2023 <https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2023-67/>`_.

Why is downscaling important ⛈?
---------------------------------

Downscaling of climate information is crucial because of the widespread and diverse effects of 
human-caused climate change. To better understand climate change impacts, it is essential to generate 
accurate predictions about future climate conditions at a relevant scale for studying its effects and 
creating strategies to address them. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are physics-based numerical models 
that predict future climate patterns and their effects under different assumptions of radiative forcing.
However, they have limitations. While they can replicate many current and past atmospheric processes on
large scales, they struggle with representing smaller-scale processes, like local weather patterns, clouds, 
and certain climate variables, due to their coarse resolution. Additionally, they can't adequately capture local
and regional climate variations. To overcome these limitations, GCM simulations need to be downscaled, 
allowing us to predict regional climates more accurately.

What is the Perfect Prognosis 🌏💫☔️?
---------------------------------------

Empirical Statistical Downscaling models fall into two categories: Model Output Statistics (MOS)
and Perfect Prognosis (PP). MOS uses GCM data directly to create a model with bias correction 
techniques for downscaling. However, it's inflexible because it's tied to specific GCM products.
On the other hand, PP-ESD trains the downscaling model using weather stations and large-scale
observations like reanalysis products and then connects the trained model to any GCM product 
for predicting downscaled future climates. PP establishes a relationship between larger observed 
patterns and local data, acting as a transfer function for predictions. While PP is more complex
to design and requires substantial modeling, it offers flexibility to work with various data sources.

What can PyESD do 😎 💪?
--------------------------

PyESD is an open-source Python package designed to perform Perfect Prognosis-based Empirical Statistical 
Downscaling. This package includes various modeling tools and processes. It can preprocess diverse datasets,
such as weather station data (from, e.g., German weather service, Ghana Met Agency), ERA5 analysis, CMIP5,
and CMIP6. PyESD constructs predictors and predictands (e.g., transformation and extracting teleconnection 
indices from climate variables), selects predictors using feature engineering techniques, chooses learning 
models or ensembles, predicts future climates, performs statistical analysis and provides visualizations. 
It's adaptable to different datasets, well-documented, and user-friendly. For a given weather station directory,
the stations can be loaded into the Station Operator (SO) object, then apply all the ESD routines: An example of
setting a model: 

>>> from pyESD.Weatherstation import read_station_csv
>>> from pyESD.standardizer import MonthlyStandardizer, StandardScaling
>>> SO = read_station_csv(filename=station_dir, varname=variable)
>>> SO.set_model(variable, method=regressor, scoring=scoring,
                     cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=10))

What pyESD can't do 👎?
-------------------------

The current version of pyESD doesn't include Model Output Statistics models, can't work with spatial
predictand datasets like gridded weather stations, lacks spatial learning capabilities, and can't 
directly assess impacts. It heavily relies on machine learning algorithms and simple deep learning 
architectures. While pyESD can be used with daily datasets, this capability is still experimental. 
For instance, it's possible to create a classifier within the model to predict wet or dry conditions 
before the model learning to improve performance on rainfall occurrence and extreme events. 
The pre-processing in the package can handle various weather station data formats and can be easily adapted.
The developers of pyESD welcome suggestions for improvement of the software and the documentation as well.

Who developed pyESD 👩🏿‍💻?
---------------------------

PyESD was developed by Daniel Boateng (`website <https://dan-boat.github.io/>`_), a Ph.D. student at the 
University of Tübingen, under the supervision of Dr. rer. nat Sebastian G. Mutz (`website <http://mutz.science/>`_), 
who made immense contributions to the ideas behind the pyESD modelling framework. Daniel developed the 
package alongside his Ph.D. project involving paleoclimate modeling using isotope-enabled GCMs and climate
dynamics. He's dedicated to open-source scientific software development and aims to enhance the 
reproducibility of research outcomes. He believes that science would be more fun if all research outputs 
were easily reproducible. He also created "pyClimat," another open-source package for analyzing and 
visualizing GCM model output, which has been open-source since the first day of his Ph.D. program.
Daniel believes in “Trusting The Process” (TTP) in all aspects of life.

**List of Modules and Functionalities Planned for the Upcoming Package Versions**

1. **Precipitation Classification:** Implement functionality to classify daily precipitation datasets 
into wet or dry days before training the wet days with a regressor. This enhancement aims to improve the 
model's performance on wet-occurrence days and optimize predictor sets for predicting dry days.

2. **Spatial Data Compatibility:** Extend compatibility of the predictand_base model with spatial data. 
This will enhance the spatio-temporal learning capabilities of the PP-ESD model and improve the accuracy of 
downscaled climate information.

3. **Storage Format Enhancement:** Change the storage format of constructed time series of predictors from 
pickle files to Zarr files. This change offers advantages in handling NaN data and enhances compatibility 
with various ML and Deep Learning models.

4. **Southern Hemisphere Indices:** Expand the range of teleconnection indices to include several Southern 
Hemisphere atmospheric variability indices, such as the ESNO cycle, Madden/Julian Oscillation (MJO), and PNA. 
This inclusion broadens the model's applicability to regions in the Southern Hemisphere.

5. **Benchmark Bias Correction:** Include a simple bias correction model as a benchmark for users. 
This addition will be valuable for users who require a reference point for their downscaling modeling 
or as a starting point for further customization."
