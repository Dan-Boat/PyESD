Practical examples
==================

The package has been demonstrated with using real word observation datasets.

1. Downscaling of precipitation and temperature for weather station located in the Neckar catchment, Southwestern Germany üåé
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we show the modeling routine followed in generating downscaling products for the Neckar catchment. The control scripts of the individual
steps can be found in the folder: ``examples\Neckar``. All the data used for this example is publicly available.

2. Downscaling of precipitation for synoptic weather stations in Ghana üåç using Stacked Generalization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project rely on non-open access weather station data collected from the Ghana Meteorology Agency (Gmet). The example demonstrates the use of stacking 
regressor to improve the performance of the transfer function require for downscaling monthly rainfall in Ghana. All the control scripts are located in the folder:
``examples\Ghana``
